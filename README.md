# Raindrop Webportal
Create a customisable, lightweight and statically built webportal that's maintainable using your bookmarks. This is accomplished using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the generator, and [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) as a CMS.

## Benefits over Raindrop.io's share functionality
Although Raindrop.io's bookmarking is extremely nice, their share functionality leaves two big problems that I want to work around:
- **No permalinks:** Raindrop.io's share URL format is `https://raindrop.io/{username}/{collection_name_slug}-{id}`; hardly a consistent link to point people to
- **No custom formatting:** the page's formatting is locked. You can filter on tags by clicking them, and add a description, but there it ends. Even though it is very sleek, I'd like to be able to make a more functional/organised collection.
